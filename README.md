Group 6 Project1 GitHub Repo

#This repo contains Group 6's analysis entitled 'Explorations of attributes of best employers globally and contributing factors'

#This directory contains our initial project proposal as well as the slide deck with our findings.

#The subdirectory 'Starter code' contains the four parts to our analysis. They should be read in numerical order:

 #Section 1 provides an preliminary analysis of the initial dataset 'employers_clean.csv' and its key characteristics
 
 #Section 2 provides a analysis of some financial metrics related to the companies in employers_clean.csv, using the Yfinance library. Section 2 requires the Yfinance library v0.2.4 to retrieve financial data. Install yfinance with command 'pip install yfinance==0.2.4' on command line.
 
 #Section 3 provides further financial analysis of employers_clean.csv using the NASDAQ API to compare ranked companies to their industry peers. The API call requires nasdaq-data-link library. Install nasdaq library with command ‘pip install nasdaq-data-link’ on command line. 
 
 #Section 4 provides analysis of some external factors to related to a company's country of headquarters, that may influence success in the initial rankings. For example, union participation, average wage.
 
 #All flatfile datasets used are contained in the 'resources' sub-directory.
 
 #All relevant graphs and images in the four analysis files save to the 'Images' sub-directory.
